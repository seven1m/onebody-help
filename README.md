If you're a member of a OneBody community and want to know more about how it works, swing over to [Getting Started](http://church.io/onebody/help/getting_started/README.html).

If you're planning a OneBody production environment for your church, we recommend you read the [Planning for OneBody](http://church.io/onebody/help/planning_for_installation/README.html) section.

If you're wanting to get OneBody up and running quickly in a non-production environment (e.g. for evaluation), head over to [Getting Started - for Administrators](http://church.io/onebody/help/getting_started/for-administrators.html). This will allow you to configure a system you can look at with minimal setup.

We've used some standard terms throughout these guides. You'll find them in the [glossary](GLOSSARY.html).
