If you're a member of a OneBody community and want to know more about how it works, swing over to [Getting Started](http://church.io/onebody/help/getting_started/README.html).

If you're planning a OneBody production environment for your church, we recommend you read the [Planning for OneBody](http://church.io/onebody/help/planning_for_installation/README.html) section.

If you're wanting to get OneBody up and running quickly in a non-production environment (e.g. for evaluation), head over to [Getting Started - for Administrators](http://church.io/onebody/help/getting_started/for-administrators.html). This will allow you to configure a system you can look at with minimal setup.

Throughout the guides, we use the term "member", instead of person, or user. We think the term member more accurately captures our community focus.

We've used some standard terms throughout these guides. You'll find them in the [glossary](GLOSSARY.html).
